### Dynamodb fun time!
Trying out the javascript apis with dynamodb

[Amazon has great documentation for dynamodb here.](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)


### Setup
Build the node packages for the aws sdks for the local testing.

``` npm install ```

Included are the core AWS Javascript sdk, and the new doc sdk.
[Read about the doc sdk here.](https://github.com/awslabs/dynamodb-document-js-sdk)

I ran the tests against a local instance of the dynamodb engine.
